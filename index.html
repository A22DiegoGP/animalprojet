    <h1>The Platypus</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), sometimes referred to as the duck-billed platypus, is a semiaquatic,
     egg-laying mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. The platypus is the sole living representative 
     or monotypic taxon of its family <em>(Ornithorhynchidae) and genus (Ornithorhynchus),</em> though a number of related species 
     appear in the fossil record.</p>
    
     <h2>Especial characteristic</h2>
     <p>It is one of the five extant species of <strong>monotremes,</strong> mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. <br> This species are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Platypus.
        </li>
        <li>
            Short beaked echidna.
        </li>
        <li>
            Western long-beaked echidna.
        </li>
        <li>
            Eastern long-beaked echidna.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cyclops Mountain Echidna.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>General characteristics</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                While both male and female platypuses are born with ankle spurs, only the spurs on the male's back ankles deliver venom.
            </li>
            <li>
                Monotremes are the only mammals (apart from at least one species of dolphin--the Guiana Dolphin) 
                known to have a sense of electroreception: they locate their prey in part by detecting electric fields generated by muscular contractions.
            </li>
            <li>
                In recent studies it has been suggested that the eyes of the platypus are more similar to those of Pacific hagfish or
                 Northern Hemisphere lampreys than to those of most tetrapods. The eyes also contain double cones, which most mammals do not have.
